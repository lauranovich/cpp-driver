Scylla Specific Features

Shard Awareness
---------------

The Scylla CPP driver is shard aware and contains extensions that work with the TokenAwarePolicy supported by Scylla 2.3 and onwards. 
Using this policy, the driver can select a connection to a particular shard based on the shardâ€™s token. 
As a result, latency is significantly reduced because there is no need to pass data between the shards.

For using it you only need to enable ``TokenAwarePolicy`` on the ``Cluster`` as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
   from cassandra.policies import TokenAwarePolicy, RoundRobinPolicy

   cluster = Cluster(load_balancing_policy=TokenAwarePolicy(RoundRobinPolicy()))
